# Baseball Monte Carlo Simulation Project

## 1. Introduction

This project implements a Monte Carlo simulation for baseball games to predict win probabilities between two teams (Chicago Cubs vs. Chicago White Sox). The simulation uses player statistics (Batting Average, On-Base Percentage, Slugging Percentage for batters; ERA for pitchers) loaded from CSV data files. It runs a large number of simulated games (e.g., 10,000) to derive statistical outcomes.

The primary outputs include:
* Text-based win percentages for each team.
* A comparative bar chart showing the score distribution for both teams.
* A line chart illustrating the cumulative win percentage for each team as more simulations are run.

This project was developed as part of the "Discussion 8 | Monte Carlo Simulation" assignment, emphasizing code organization, data management, and project management practices, including collaboration with AI (Gemini).

## 2. Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

* `baseball-simulation-project/`
    * `README.md` (This file)
    * `documentation_and_project_management_artifacts/`
        * `Activity_List.md`
        * `Functional_Specs.md`
        * `Product_Backlog.md`
        * `Roadmap.md`
        * `Status_Log.md`
        * `Work_Breakdown_Structure.md`
    * `functional_code/`
        * `baseball_simulation.py`
    * `prepared_data/`
        * `cubs_standard_batting_clean.csv`
        * `cubs_standard_pitching_clean.csv`
        * `whitesox_standard_batting_clean.csv`
        * `whitesox_standard_pitching_clean.csv`
    * `results/`
        * `comparative_score_distribution.png`
        * `cumulative_win_percentage.png`

* **`/functional_code/`**: Contains the Python script (`baseball_simulation.py`) that runs the simulation.
* **`/prepared_data/`**: Contains the cleaned CSV data files for player and pitcher statistics used by the simulation. These files were sourced from the `pitch-by-pitch-pro` repository.
* **`/documentation_and_project_management_artifacts/`**: Houses all project planning and documentation. See links below for details.
* **`/results/`**: Stores the visual outputs (plots) generated by the simulation.
* **`README.md`**: Provides an overview of the project (this file).


## 3. How to Run

1.  **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Python installed, along with the `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `numpy` libraries.
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib numpy
    ```
2.  **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hongyu-liao/baseball-simulation-project
    cd baseball-simulation-project
    ```
3.  **Ensure Data is Present**: The `prepared_data` folder should contain the four necessary CSV files:
    * `cubs_standard_batting_clean.csv`
    * `cubs_standard_pitching_clean.csv`
    * `whitesox_standard_batting_clean.csv`
    * `whitesox_standard_pitching_clean.csv`
4.  **Run the Simulation**: Navigate to the `functional_code` directory and execute the Python script:
    ```bash
    cd functional_code
    python baseball_simulation.py
    ```
5.  **View Results**:
    * Text output showing win percentages will be printed to the console.
    * Image files (`comparative_score_distribution.png` and `cumulative_win_percentage.png`) will be saved in the `results` directory (which will be created in the `functional_code` directory if it doesn't exist there, or you can adjust the save path in the script to point to the root `results/` folder).

## 5. AI Collaboration

Generative AI (Gemini) was utilized as a co-developer in this project to assist with:
* Initial code structure and boilerplate generation.
* Drafting and refining project management documentation.
* Brainstorming solutions and debugging code.
* Generating code snippets for specific functionalities (e.g., plotting).

Details of this collaboration are reflected in the [Status Log](./documentation_and_project_management_artifacts/Status_Log.md) and [Activity List](./documentation_and_project_management_artifacts/Activity_List.md).
