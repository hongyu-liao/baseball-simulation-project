| 2025-05-20 10:30:00 | Hongyu Liao and Yiwei Li implemented the Monte Carlo simulation loop (for 10,000 iterations) and added win percentage calculation.      | Hongyu Liao, Yiwei Li                       |
| 2025-05-20 11:30:00 | Conducted initial testing and code cleanup for the Python script.                                                                       | Yiwei Li, Hongyu Liao, Gemini (AI)         |
| 2025-05-20 14:00:00 | Team discussion on the initial framework for project management documents.                                                              | Yiwei Li, Hongyu Liao, Ziyang Huang         |
| 2025-05-21 09:00:00 | Yiwei Li, Hongyu Liao, and Ziyang Huang created the GitHub repository `baseball-simulation-project` and set up the initial folder structure as per assignment requirements. | Yiwei Li, Hongyu Liao, Ziyang Huang         |
