| 2025-05-19 | Project initiated. Cloned template repository structure. Began drafting initial Functional Specs with AI co-developer (Gemini).   | [Your Name(s)] | Decided to focus on core Monte Carlo simulation of 9-inning games using basic stats (AVG, OBP, SLG, ERA).          |
| 2025-05-20 | Developed initial Python script for simulating a single game (at-bat, inning logic). AI assisted with boilerplate code for classes. | [Your Name(s)], AI | Basic classes (Player, Pitcher, GameState) defined. Simplified probability model for at-bats adopted for initial version. |
| 2025-05-20 | Implemented CSV data loading for batters and pitchers using Pandas. Added error handling for missing/malformed data.                 | [Your Name(s)] | Confirmed CSV columns needed: Player, BA, OBP, SLG for batters; Player, ERA for pitchers. Default stats for error cases. |
| 2025-05-21 | Implemented Monte Carlo simulation loop to run 1000 games and aggregate win/loss results. AI helped refine loop logic.           | [Your Name(s)], AI | Output format decided: win counts and percentages for each team. Simplified tie handling (counted as non-win).      |
| 2025-05-21 | Began creating project management artifacts as per assignment requirements (WBS, Backlog, etc.). AI assisted with content generation based on existing code and discussions. | [Your Name(s)], AI |  |
| (Future Entry) | Tested simulation with 1000 runs. Results appear reasonable for a simplified model.                                           | [Your Name(s)] | Verified no crashes during batch simulation.                                                                           |
| (Future Entry) | Finalized documentation and repository structure.                                                                                 | [Your Name(s)] | All required MD files created and placed in the correct directory.                                                       |
