| 2025-05-19 | Project initiated. Cleaned CSV data from the `pitch-by-pitch-pro` repository's `/data/clean/` directory was identified as the data source.                            | Yiwei Li, Hongyu Liao                      | Decided to use existing cleaned data to streamline data acquisition for this assignment.                                                      |
| 2025-05-19 | Hongyu Liao and Yiwei Li collaboratively worked on loading batter (`standard_batting_clean.csv`) and pitcher (`standard_pitching_clean.csv`) data for Cubs and White Sox using Pandas. Hongyu Liao focused on the primary implementation of data loading functions. | Hongyu Liao, Yiwei Li                      | Confirmed key columns: Player, BA, OBP, SLG (batters); Player, ERA (pitchers). Included basic error handling for invalid data by using defaults. |
| 2025-05-19 | Yiwei Li, Hongyu Liao, and AI (Gemini) collaborated to structure the Python simulation script. `Player`, `Pitcher`, and `GameState` classes were defined.          | Yiwei Li, Hongyu Liao, Gemini (AI)         | Basic attributes and methods for classes outlined. AI provided initial templates for class structures.                                   |
| 2025-05-19 | Hongyu Liao and Yiwei Li developed the `simulate_at_bat_no_print` function, focusing on outcome probabilities and result determination. Gemini (AI) assisted with debugging. | Hongyu Liao, Yiwei Li, Gemini (AI)         | A simplified probability model based on player AVG, OBP, SLG, and pitcher ERA was implemented for at-bat outcomes.                  |
| 2025-05-19 | Yiwei Li and Hongyu Liao implemented the `simulate_inning_half_no_print` and `simulate_game_no_print` functions for game flow. Gemini (AI) participated in logic review. | Yiwei Li, Hongyu Liao, Gemini (AI)         | Implemented the basic flow for a 9-inning game and conditions for early game termination.                                                     |
| 2025-05-19 | Hongyu Liao and Yiwei Li jointly implemented the Monte Carlo simulation loop (1000 iterations) for batch game runs and result tallying. Gemini (AI) assisted with loop optimization. | Hongyu Liao, Yiwei Li, Gemini (AI)         | Determined output as win counts and percentages. Simplified tie handling.                                                                   |
| 2025-05-19 | GitHub repository `[baseball-simulation-project]` created, and initial folder structure was set up by the team as per assignment requirements.                                      | Yiwei Li, Hongyu Liao, Ziyang Huang        | Repository includes `functional_code`, `prepared_data`, `documentation_and_project_management_artifacts`, etc.                        |
| 2025-05-19 | Yiwei Li, Hongyu Liao, and Ziyang Huang collaboratively discussed and began drafting project management artifacts. AI (Gemini) assisted in generating initial drafts based on current code and project discussions. | Yiwei Li, Hongyu Liao, Ziyang Huang, Gemini (AI) | Initial drafts for Functional Specs, WBS, Product Backlog, Status Log (this document), Activity List, and Roadmap were created.        |
| 2025-05-21 | (Example future entry) Reviewed and updated all project management documents to ensure accuracy and compliance with requirements.                | Yiwei Li, Hongyu Liao, Ziyang Huang        | Final confirmation of the completeness of all documentation.                                                                                   |
| (Example future entry) | Completed testing of 10,000 simulation runs. Results align with expectations for the simplified model.                                       | Yiwei Li, Hongyu Liao, Gemini (AI)         | Verified code stability during batch simulations; no crashes encountered.                                                                      |
